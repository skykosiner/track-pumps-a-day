**This is only useful for me, but hey if you want you can look around**

## The Problem
I'm asthmatic, and recently I got a new inhaler, but you're only supposed to
have a max of 10 pumps a day. So I wanted a way which I can track it between my
computer, phone, and any other device. So this is just a little api I can use
to send updates, and get updates on how many times I have taken it a day.

The file gets cleared by automation on my phone every day at 12am using siri
shortcuts, no logic for that going on in go.

And yes I'm not giving you degens the api route, I don't want you messing with my stuff
